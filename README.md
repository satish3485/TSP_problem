### Implementation 

	I  create maven project in java. In this project 
	i am using Nearest neighbour algorithm.
	 And after that i use the Ant colony algorithm and 
	 Two opt algorithm.
	 And than i got the my minimum solution. I use the
	 search seed file to find the seed
	 
### How to run the progam 
	
	I put jar file in and i run it from mac command line
	with this command 

### IN Eclipse

	Import the maven project and put the parameter is 
	for example ../problems/ch130.tsp
	
### mac command line
	go to directory name code 
	$ mvn compile
	$ mvn -q exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="tsp.antcolony.Main" -Dexec.args="ch130.tsp"
	
	
### system detail 
	 system  macOS High Sierra
	 version 10.13.6
	 processor  2.2 GHZ Intel core i7
	 
### Result
	I am implement the funtion which write result in
	result folder and inside the name of problem for
	 example ch130 and there are two file and one is 
	 result and another is seed file and it's print result
	  also with the length in end of file. and it print 
	  the result in console also
